        My name is Mike Garcia and I have completed the Full Stack Web Development course from Southern Methodist University!  I am currently interested in a junior web developer position and am comfortable working within the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and have also worked with HTML/CSS/Javascript as well as jQuery.  
    </p>
    <p class="biocontent2"> 
         I enjoy collaborating with others to achieve a common goal and doing whatever it takes to get the job done!  Although I recently graduated, I am confident in my ability to add value to any team through my perseverence, positivity, and strong work-ethic.
