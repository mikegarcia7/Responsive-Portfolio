        My name is Mike Garcia and I am an upcoming Web Developer!  I just finished Week 1 of SMU Coding Bootcamp.  Although the pacing is fast, I have been able to keep up with the pace! At least for now...

    <p class="biocontent2"> 
        Prior to Web Development, I was a percussion director for seven years.  I had the opportunity to work with students from 6th-12th grade and teach percussion all day everyday!  I loved it!  While I have learned so much from them, and from the world-class staff over the years, I was ready to learn some new skills focusing on technology!   
    </p>
    <p class="biocontent2"> I am excited for what's in store as a Web Developer!  Even though I've only been immersed in this material for a week, I feel like I have gained so much knowledge!  I can't wait to see what else there is to learn in the big world of Web Development!
